# Foursphere

## Description

Foursphere allows users to visualize their checkins with an interactive globe. This RoR application utilizes [Foursquare's API](https://developer.foursquare.com/) to access checkin data & implements Google Data Arts Team's [WebGL Globe](https://github.com/dataarts/webgl-globe/) (powered by [three.js](http://threejs.org/)) to create an interactive globe.
